Aeroponics for the home,
development is currently in alpha so use on your own risk.

------

# Introduction
The goal of this repository is to contain all the information needed to get,
build and run an aeroponic system. The idea is to design a cheap modular system
that anyone can use.

## The project is divided into two parts
1. The development of a small test system which is intended for developers who
   are interested in running experiments on a small scale.
2. The production system which is closet sized with the focus on maximum
   production of biomass. Both systems are controlled by an Arduino Uno and can
   use the same hardware and software, the only difference will be the size.

Information about how to build and run the systems will be added to the wiki.

# Software instructions
* arduino_sketch - contains the arduino sketch file which you need to upload to
  your arduino uno.

# Working with now
Adding information to the wiki about the list of materials you need for the
developer system, starting with the irrigation.

# TODO
* wiki
  + developer system
  + list of materials
  + irrigation
  + electronics/sensors
  + buckets and growth environment
  + nutrient solution
  + LED system
* production system
